    "\n",
    "$$q(\\mu, \\beta) = q(\\mu)q(\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally it is a requirement for the analytic formulation of Variational Bayes that the 'noise' and 'signal' parameters are factorised. In more complex examples where there is more than one 'signal' parameter (e.g. we are inferring the parameters of a complex nonlinear model), a combined distribution may be used for the multiple signal parameters, however the noise must still be factorised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another requirement for analytic VB is the choice of 'conjugate' distributions for the priors $P(\\mu)$, $P(\\beta)$, and the posteriors $q(\\mu)$ and $q(\\beta)$. This arises from Bayes's theorem which in our approximate form is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$q(\\mu)q(\\beta) \\propto P(\\textbf{Y} | \\mu, \\beta)P(\\mu)P(\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $P(\\textbf{Y} | \\mu, \\beta)$ is the likelihood and is determined from the Gaussian data model given above. It turns out that if we choose certain types of distribution for the priors $P(\\mu)$ and $P(\\beta)$, then $q(\\mu)$ and $q(\\beta)$ will end up having the same type of distribution. These 'special' distributions are known as the 'conjugate' distributions *for the likelihood*. Conjugate distributions depend on the exact form of the likelihood function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not prove the conjugate distributions for this likelihood, but will simply state that for a Gaussian data model as above, the conjugate distribution for $\\mu$ is Gaussian, the the conjugate distribution for $\\beta$ is a Gamma distribution:\n",

    "$\\mu$, and through the VB formulation we will infer values for them from the data. $m_0$ and $v_0$ similarly describe our prior knowledge of the likely value of $\\mu$ and might incorporate existing knowledge. Alternatively by choosing a large value of $v_0$ we can have a 'non-informative' prior which would be used if we have no real idea before seeing the data what the value of $\\mu$ might be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly for $\\beta$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(c_0)}\\frac{\\beta^{c_0-1}}{b_0^{c_0}}\\exp{-\\frac{\\beta}{b_0}}$$\n",
