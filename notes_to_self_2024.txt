Course 2024 Notes to self

Preparation
- https://gitlab.jsc.fz-juelich.de/training/blueprint/-/wikis/system-reservation#reservation (Sonderw√ºnsche is on the second page)
- Just JUSUF-GPUS would be enough (first day 36000/50000 requested hours were used, overall 58000 was used given that one day was a fallback)

Technical issues with Jupyter

- Reservations have to start at 8.30
- Possibly the nodes have to be started before the course so that they boot beforehand and one does not have to wait for that
-

Kernels

- After making a kernel one needs to make it visible to other members of the project

	* I created two files on the sc_venv_XXXXX : create_kernel_project.sh - if you change something on the kernels, this should re-create the link - although I don't think it's necessary. 
	* And one needs to enable the julich project before with jutil env activate -p training2405
	* I modified the script, in order to create kernels for the project.

- Multiprocessing issue - do not use srun in the kernel template
- Problem with the env stuck on initialisation:

	* Kept IPython on the modules file and added "tornado" to the modules (ipykernel needs it)
	* Removed ipykernel from requirements as it comes from there

	* cleaned $HOME/.local on jusuf from this 12:39 garbage


Material

- First notebook = first day - 30 min
- Second notebook = second day + 30 min
- Third notebook = third day, always check timings and Colab
- Fourth set of notebooks: fourth day + BNN but math can be given slower
- BNNs: very primitive examples, maybe find something better
- Last day was only VAE and flows, ended at 11.20

Problems during the course

- People do not see the right folder because they chose the wrong project or did not specify the partition, or resources: delete the lab, create a new one [documentation seemed to have been not that good, check the hedgedoc]
- everything is blank: delete, log out and in again
- do not see the partition: chose the wrong resources
- inactive reservations: log out and log in
- strange view: wrong resources; possibly delete all Jupyter labs
